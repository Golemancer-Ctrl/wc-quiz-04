## Description

In this assignment, we constructed from scratch a fully responsive, timed quiz game.  I learned quite a bit about many features of JavaScript and API interaction.  Local storage, timers, scorekeeping, event listeners, and arrays are just part of what this project touched upon.  It is certainly the most complex project to date, and was certainly a challenge.  To think that something so complicated and reactive can be done with only around a hundred lines of JavaScript, some basic styling, and a html framework to work off of is pretty incredible.

The lessons I have learned in the making of this project will carry with me for years.  This is the first really involved project of our course and certainly the most complicated code I've written to date.  I hope to use what I've learned here in my personal and professional projects going forward.
